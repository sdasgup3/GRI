The baseline of our evaluation will be the open source Graphal~\cite{Graphal} 
system.  Graphal~\cite{Graphal} is an interpreter of a programming language that 
is mainly oriented to graph algorithms. There is a command line interpreter and 
a graphical integrated development environment. The IDE contains text editor for 
programmers, compilation and script output, advanced debugger and visualization 
window. The evaluation will be between command line version of Graphal with our
implementation.
  The evaluation will
  cover the following two aspects of our implementation:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The convenience and intuitive extensibility provided by our 
    programming model.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We will be implementing a couple of well know graph algorithms in 
      both baseline and our implementation
        and use number of dynamic instructions interpreted as a measure to show 
        the conciseness of our
        representation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Performance
    \begin{itemize}
      \item As we are planning to keep the compiled version of frequently used 
      graph routines (like dfs\_iterators(vertex), bfs\_iterators(vertex)), we 
      are expecting to achieve better performance in terms of runtime.  
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
