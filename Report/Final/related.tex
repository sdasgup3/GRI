Our work in mostly inspired by the line of work by GUESS ~\cite{Adar} and
Graphal ~\cite{Graphal}.
GUESS, a novel system for graph
exploration that combines an interpreted language with a
graphical front end that allows researchers to rapidly prototype
and deploy new visualizations. GUESS also contains a novel,
interactive interpreter that connects the language and interface in
a way that facilities exploratory visualization tasks. Our
language, Gython, is a domain-specific embedded language
which provides all the advantages of Python with new, graph
specific operators, primitives, and shortcuts.

Graphal is an interpreter of a programming language that is mainly oriented to
graph algorithms. There is a command line interpreter and a graphical
integrated development environment. The IDE contains text editor for
programmers, compilation and script output, advanced debugger and visualization
window. The progress of the interpreted and debugged graph algorithm can be
displayed in 3D scene.

Our language design is very similar to above two work. But we additionally provided
built-in functions for basic graph algorithms. This not only help us getting
convinient short hand notations to compute those basic algorithms, but also we gain on 
performance due the fact that those basic algorithms are now compiled.
