As graphical models are increasingly become popular
in various field, the domain experts often struggle to represent and compute on
such model in a convenient and efficient way. In this project we develop a
dynamically typed language to represent and compute on the graphical models
which provides both the desired convenience without loosing much on the
efficiency.
