As graphical models are increasingly become popular
in various fields, the domain experts often struggle to represent and compute on
such models in a convenient and efficient way. In this project we develop a
dynamically typed language 
which provides the desired convenience of representation of those models without loosing much on the
efficiency of doing computation on them.
